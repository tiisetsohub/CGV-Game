# CGV-Game
Repo for Three.js CGV project

To run it in your browser, type `parcel ./src/index.html` in your terminal

It will build and generate a link which you can click and see the project. I used parcel as a bundler so that things are a bit more organised and the site will refresh with every change you make

I'd suggest you use Chrome as Safari does have a few issues with rendering three.js projects

If all goes well, you should see a spinning lime cube
